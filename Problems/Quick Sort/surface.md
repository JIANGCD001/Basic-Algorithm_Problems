## Describe
Use the Quick Sort Algorithm to sort the $N$ numbers which are read in from small to large, and then output.  
The Quick Sort Algorithm is one of the basic algorithms in OI. Someone who do not understand it can search the Internet for some details, and solved it alone after understanding it.(For someone who uses C++, though you can solve it smoothly with the function `sort`, you have not understood the quintessence of the Quick Sort Algorithm.)
## Input Form
There is a positive integer $N$. The second line includes $N$ numbers $a_i$ which are separated by spaces. For all the numbers you need to sort, the input promises $a_i \le 10^9$.
## Output Form
Output the $N$ numbers from small to large, and separate them with spaces. Change the line at the end of the line with no spaces.
## Examples
### Input #1
```
5
4 2 4 5 1
```
### Output #1
```
1 2 4 4 5
```
## Instructions/Tips
### Data Scale and Agreement
For the $20 \percent$ of the data, $N \le 10^3$.  
For the $100 \%$ of the data, $N \le 10^5$.
